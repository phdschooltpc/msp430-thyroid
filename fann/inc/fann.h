/* Section: FANN Creation/Execution
   
   The FANN library is designed to be very easy to use. 
   A feedforward ann can be created by a simple <fann_create_standard> function, while
   other ANNs can be created just as easily. The ANNs can be trained by <fann_train_on_file>
   and executed by <fann_run>.
   
   All of this can be done without much knowledge of the internals of ANNs, although the ANNs created will
   still be powerful and effective. If you have more knowledge about ANNs, and desire more control, almost
   every part of the ANNs can be parametrized to create specialized and highly optimal ANNs.

/* ----- Macros used to define DLL external entrypoints ----- */ 
/*
 DLL Export, import and calling convention for Windows.
 Only defined for Microsoft VC++ FANN_EXTERNAL indicates
 that a function will be exported/imported from a dll
 FANN_API ensures that the DLL calling convention
 will be used for  a function regardless of the calling convention
 used when compiling.

 For a function to be exported from a DLL its prototype and
 declaration must be like this:
    FANN_EXTERNAL void FANN_API function(char *argument)

 The following ifdef block is a way of creating macros which
 make exporting from a DLL simple. All files within a DLL are
 compiled with the FANN_DLL_EXPORTS symbol defined on the
 command line. This symbol should not be defined on any project
 that uses this DLL. This way any other project whose source
 files include this file see FANN_EXTERNAL functions as being imported
 from a DLL, whereas a DLL sees symbols defined with this
 macro as being exported which makes calls more efficient.
 The __stdcall calling convention is used for functions in a
 windows DLL.

 The callback functions for fann_set_callback must be declared as FANN_API
 so the DLL and the application program both use the same
 calling convention.

/*
 The following sets the default for MSVC++ 2003 or later to use
 the fann dll's. To use a lib or fixedfann.c, floatfann.c or doublefann.c
 with those compilers FANN_NO_DLL has to be defined before
 including the fann headers.
 The default for previous MSVC compilers such as VC++ 6 is not
 to use dll's. To use dll's FANN_USE_DLL has to be defined before
 including the fann headers.

/* Function: fann_create_standard
	
	Creates a standard fully connected backpropagation neural network.

	There will be a bias neuron in each layer (except the output layer),
	and this bias neuron will be connected to all neurons in the next layer.
	When running the network, the bias nodes always emits 1.
	
	To destroy a <struct fann> use the <fann_destroy> function.

	Parameters:
		num_layers - The total number of layers including the input and the output layer.
		... - Integer values determining the number of neurons in each layer starting with the 
			input layer and ending with the output layer.
			
	Returns:
		A pointer to the newly created <struct fann>.
			
	Example:
		> // Creating an ANN with 2 input neurons, 1 output neuron, 
		> // and two hidden layers with 8 and 9 neurons
		> struct fann *ann = fann_create_standard(4, 2, 8, 9, 1);
